## About me

<img style="right" src="assets/profile pic.jpg" width="250"> 

Hi! I'm Hung. I'm a [Vingroup Scholar](https://scholarships.vinuni.edu.vn/masters-ph-d-scholarship-program/) nominee applying to graduate schools. My field of study would be Computer Science, with specialization in Artificial Intelligence (Computer Vision to be more precise).

Working at [Intel Vietnam](https://www.intel.vn/content/www/vn/vi/homepage.html) as an undergrad intern was my 1st foray into Computer Vision. The experience inspired me to do a thesis on depth estimation for robotic arms, supervised by Profs. [Quoc-Chi Nguyen](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=U1re1xgAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Phuong-Tung Pham](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=xM8EO0oAAAAJ&hl=en). I also worked at [VinBigData](https://vinbigdata.com/en/) for a short time, mainly on Natural Language Processing tasks. 

**My research interests**: monocular depth estimation, robotics, image segmentation.
